# Color Code Adherence in AI Image Generation: A Case Study on Gemini

This repository contains a two-part case study on achieving precise color adherence with Google's **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image** ("Nano Banana") model. The project includes:

- **The Generation Notebook** (`interactive_generator.ipynb`): A practical, interactive tool that demonstrates how to use the superior Image-Reference method.
- **The Evaluation Notebook** (`evaluation_notebook.ipynb`): A 50-sample quantitative analysis that evaluates the accuracy of the Image-Reference method compared to traditional text prompts.
